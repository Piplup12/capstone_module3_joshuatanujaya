This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques, while ensuring the model remains interpretable and actionable through Explainable AI (XAI). The dataset used contains customer demographics, service details, and account information, which collectively inform whether a customer is likely to discontinue their service.

To build a robust predictive model, data preprocessing was carried out using a ColumnTransformer that handles both numerical and categorical features—scaling continuous variables and applying one-hot encoding to categorical ones. One of the main challenges was the class imbalance between churned and retained customers. To address this, a RandomUnderSampler was applied, ensuring the model received balanced input during training.

The final model selected was a tuned LightGBM classifier, chosen for its balance between performance and interpretability. Hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of leaves, and maximum bin size were carefully optimized. Performance evaluation was focused on the F2-score, which places more emphasis on recall—a critical metric in churn scenarios, where missing a potential churner can be more costly than a false alarm. Threshold optimization further improved prediction quality by adjusting the decision threshold from the default 0.5 to 0.36, resulting in a better balance of precision and recall.

Beyond model accuracy, this project integrates Explainable AI techniques to demystify the model's decisions. Feature importance from LightGBM highlighted key drivers of churn, such as contract type, tenure, and monthly charges. SHAP was used to visualize both global and local feature contributions, helping to understand how specific customer attributes lead to churn predictions. LIME was also applied to interpret individual predictions, offering intuitive, human-readable explanations.

The inclusion of XAI in this project adds significant value for business stakeholders. It bridges the gap between technical insights and strategic action, allowing companies to understand not just who is likely to churn, but why. This transparency enables more targeted retention strategies, better communication with customers, and ultimately, improved business outcomes.
